    <p class="aboutMe">My friends would definitely describe me as hilarious, witty, and the smartest person they know.
      While this may be true, I am also hard working, reliable, and a team player. 
      <br><br>
      I have a strong moral drive to understand people. I have worked hard to develop empathy for others. You might even
      catch me crying on the elliptical at the gym while watching a family episode of Survivor. Now, it is my turn to
      help find solutions for life’s problems, and make it look good in the process!

        <p class="csAbout">In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, I identified a common concern that many travelers
          had: airline reliability.
          <br><br>
          This case study outlines the UX research steps I took to identify the problem, brainstorm a solution, and then
          design an app that allows travelers to feel a little more comfortable booking that flight.

          <h2 class="csTitle">Second Chance Chi</h2>
          <p class="csAbout">While trying to identify a non-profit’s website that needed updating, we found an
            organization called Second Chance Chi. As a group of people who love dogs and have a passion for rescue
            animals, we decided that we wanted to redesign their website to increase usability.
            <br><br>
            This case study outlines the UX research steps we took to identify the problem with the current website,
            brainstorm a solution, and then design mobile and desktop iterations of their new website.
