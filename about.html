      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My friends would definitely describe me as hilarious, witty, and the smartest person they know.
        While this may be true, I am also hard working, reliable, and a team player. 

        I have a strong moral drive to understand people. I have worked hard to develop empathy for others. You might
        even
        catch me crying on the elliptical at the gym while watching a family episode of Survivor. Now, it is my turn to
        help find solutions for life’s problems, and make it look good in the process!

        As a former elementary school teacher, I have developed organization, creativity, and storytelling skills. After
        deciding to make a career switch, I joined the UI/UX bootcamp through the University Of Utah. I successfully
        finished the bootcamp in August 2023.</p>
